      \ analysis, so the temperature calculation occurs at\_each iteration, you have\
      \ several iterations within each time step, and you have several time steps\
      \ within each orbital position. So, the temperature calculation during the transient\
      \ for each iteration\_needs to converge, so when the temperature at each iteration\

      \ solver itself, then the temperature of the time step has been calculated so\

The link between the two successive orbital positions is, for a transient analysis, the temperatures calculation of the next orbital position is initialised with the temperature results of the previous orbital position. There are two types of criteria: a steady state and transient criteria. the steady state occurs only within the full orbit, not between each orbital position. But then, you have also a convergence criteria for the transient analysis, i.e. within the transient analysis, so the temperature calculation occurs at_each iteration, you have several iterations within each time step, and you have several time steps within each orbital position. So, the temperature calculation during the transient for each iteration_needs to converge, so when the temperature at each iteration has converged, according to the convergence_criteria defined within the transient solver itself, then the temperature of the time step has been calculated so it then calculates the temperature of the next time step by doing the same process, i.e. calculating the temperatures at each iteration, etc."

  - text: "You create the Reduced Thermal Mathematical Model: you group and condense the nodes that can be considered at the same temperature (isothermal) with the same material properties part by part Then you create the Reduced Geometrical Mathematical Model: you alter the mesh of the Detailed Geometrical Mathematical Model to match with the group of thermal nodes that can be considered isothermal you redefine the geometries associated to the nodes of Detailed Geometrical Mathematical Model that are being merged into single nodes by altering them to larger surfaces or increasing the size of the meshes by preserving the same total area and using the coordinates of the existing shells of the groups of nodes of Detailed Geometrical Mathematical Model that are being merged into single nodes. The final goal should be to get the same GRs as obtained by the reduction process. You correlate the Reduced Thermal Mathematical Model with the Detailed Thermal Mathematical Model: you compare the nodal capacitance-weighted mean temperatures of the group of detailed thermal nodes that can be considered isothermal with the temperatures of their corresponding reduced thermal model nodes for the worst hot and cold steady state analysis cases. Compare the heat fluxes of groups of the detailed thermal model nodes that are being merged into single nodes with the reduced thermal model nodes for the worst hot and cold steady state analysis cases. If all the ECSS correlations criteria are met then the correlations are successful. If all the ECSS correlations criteria are not met identify the reduced thermal model nodes that failed to meet these criteria. Analyse the temperatures and heat fluxes differences between the reduced thermal models nodes and their corresponding detailed thermal model nodes groups that failed to meet these criteria. When performing a heat fluxes balance on the detailed thermal model nodes groups that fail to meet the correlations criteria if the conduction predominates over the radiation for those particular groups of nodes then calculate the optimised positive thermal conductive couplings for the reduced thermal model nodes needed to get the targeted mean temperatures (weighted by nodal capacitance) and heat fluxes of their corresponding groups of detailed thermal model nodes. If the radiation predominates over the conduction (high radiative couplings) for these particular groups of nodes especially the nodes of the external surfaces then perform the surface area-weighted mean thermo-optical properties needed to get the targeted mean temperatures (weighted by nodal capacitance) and heat fluxes of their corresponding groups of detailed thermal model nodes. Overlap the resulting nodal breakdown of the worst hot and cold steady state analysis cases of the reduced thermal models. For the transient analysis adjust and optimise the thermal capacitances of the reduced thermal nodes so their temperatures profiles over time match with the temperatures profiles of their corresponding detailed thermal model nodes groups over time."
